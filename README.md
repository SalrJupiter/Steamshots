# Building
The source code comes as an ADT Eclipse Juno project. Just copy the SteamScreenshots folder to your workspace and press Debug or Run.

To modify the Steam protobuf messages (located in `/proto`), you need the Protocol Buffers addon for Eclipse and the protobuf compiler `protoc`. In the Protocol Buffers settings in Eclipse, enable Java output to `src` folder.
